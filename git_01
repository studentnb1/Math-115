## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
"SISTER, sister, go to bed!  
Go and rest your weary head."  
Thus the prudent brother said.  
"Do you want a battered hide,  
Or scratches to your face applied?"  



## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree  
Toward heaven still,  
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill  
Beside it, and there may be two or three  
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.  



## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  
      
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
Oh, water, essence of life's flow,  
A precious gift from depths below,  
From mountain springs to ocean's vast,  
You quench our thirst, our spirits en masse.  

In rivers' dance, you freely roam,  
Carving canyons with gentle foam,  
Your melodies, a soothing rhyme,  
Embracing shores, marking time.  

A tranquil lake, a mirrored sky,  
Reflecting beauty, oh so high,  
Beneath your surface, secrets keep,  
A world unseen, where wonders creep.  

In raindrops falling from above,  
You nourish Earth with tender love,  
Reviving fields, refreshing souls,  
A symphony as each droplet rolls.  

In waterfalls, your power cascades,  
A roaring force that never fades,  
An awe-inspiring, majestic sight,  
Igniting wonder, pure delight.  

Within the ocean's vast expanse,  
Endless depths where mysteries dance,  
A kingdom teeming with vibrant life,  
In coral reefs, a colorful strife.  

You cleanse our bodies, cleanse our minds,  
In baths, in showers, and gentle tides,  
Revitalizing, washing away,  
All troubles held throughout the day.  

In frozen form, you turn to ice,  
Creating landscapes, a winter's spice,  
Glittering crystals, shimmering white,  
Transforming the world, a dazzling sight.  

Oh, water, you're the elixir of all,  
An element on which we eternally call,  
From birth to end, you're intertwined,  
A symbol of life, forever kind.  

Let us cherish and protect your grace,  
Preserve your purity, embrace your space,  
For in your essence, we find our rebirth,  
Water, the source of life on Earth.
